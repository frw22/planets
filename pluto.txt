Hi, Fraser!
Can you see this?

A: We can talk through this, so I won't annoy you with that many emails again!

F: Good idea. Maybe this will lead to a conflict, or I might have pulled it after you made your edit

A: What you think? Is this properly working?

A: Also, I don't know if this has been sent.

F: It has! I think this is working pretty well
